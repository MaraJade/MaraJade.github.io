LPT: Don't say you're gonna do something daily, then slide into a depression
spell. Not great for productivity, those.

To be honest, I mostly set a daily goal in the hopes that I would at least hit
somewhere around once a week, so maybe I should just say that. And figure out
what it is exactly that I'm doing here.

Posting pics of Minecraft maybe.

Actually, that's not a bad idea. Let's do that. I mean, I'm currently writing
this as I wait for the server I'm playing on to finish restarting. Might as well
get something productive out of that, right?
