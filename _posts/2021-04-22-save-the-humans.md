Today is Earth Day. The day where we are supposed to take some time to think
about the environment and what we're doing to it as a species. Save the
planet/whales/etc and all that. While I think those are important goals, and I
absolutely agree with them, I'm not sure how effective they are at getting
people to care. In fact, in some cases, the people who have the most ability to
change and stop the devastation of the environment not only don't care about
<insert cute animal here>, they might actually be in favor of destroying it so
they can use that habitat to make more money. Fuckers.

I think there's a much better slogan to use, that might actually get people to
care: Save the Humans! The planet? It's going to be *fine*. It might become
hell, most life might go extinct (which is bad, don't get me wrong), but life
will go on unless we manage to sterilize the entire surface with nukes. Not
completely out of the question, but environmentalism isn't going to stop that,
either. No, we should focus on saving *ourselves*. We are much more vulnerable
than life in general. Life will go on, one way or another. Humanity won't.

Climate change comes with horrifying effects that are starting to be felt
already: chaotic, violent weather; rising sea levels; drought and famine. And
those will lead to even more migration and refugees than we already have, and
many more wars as people fight over the last bits of arable land and fresh
water.

So this Earth Day, and the next one, and the next, and all the days in between,
remember: Save the Humans! Eat less meat, use less oil, vote for people who
acknowledge reality, science, and reason! Save ourselves, save yourself.

Thanks for reading, and may the Force be with us all.
