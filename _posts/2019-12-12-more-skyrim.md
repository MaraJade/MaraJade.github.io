More skyrim!

We're going to start off with this one, which I think was just a nice pic I
took.

Here we have the Grove of the Ancestor Moth (I think). It's really pretty.

Here's the skylight.

Such a nice tree.

I have no idea what this is, but it's interesting at least.

![First wayshrine of Auri-El](/assets/images/screenshots/skyrim/20190407210850_1.jpg)

Here we have a wayshrine of Auri-El, and the last remaining Snow Elf.
Knight-Paladin Gelebor? That sounds vaguely correct.

Here he is from a different angle.

A nice shot of a moon somewhere in that wayshrine mess.

![Statue of Auri-El in front of temple](/assets/images/screenshots/skyrim/20190407231432_1.jpg)

The statue of Auri-El in front of his temple or chantry or whatever it's
specifically called, I don't remember.

![Pool of holy water](/assets/images/screenshots/skyrim/20190407231510_1.jpg)

I think this is the pool after you've poured your jug into it, as it's glowing
green.

And now we skip to the aetherium forge, which I've probably misspelled.

![The forge itself](/assets/images/screenshots/skyrim/20190408200851_1.jpg)

Here is the forge itself!

I don't know where this is, but I love the sky in Skyrim. So beautiful.

![View of trees and lake](/assets/images/screenshots/skyrim/20190410135511_1.jpg)

I'm pretty sure this is the view from the house at Falkreath. That's my favorite
house, even with all the giants and stuff wandering by.

![Bleak Falls Barrow](/assets/images/screenshots/skyrim/20190410135525_1.jpg)

Ah, Bleak Falls Barrow!

I think I'll stop there, as the next series of images is from Soltheim, so I'll
just make that a post. Theoretically.
