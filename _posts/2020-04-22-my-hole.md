More Minecraft! I've been playing a lot of it recently, so here are some more
shots of my base. I'm bad at remembering to take screenshots so they're out of
date as usual, but they are quite impressive if I do say so myself.

As mentioned in my last post, I'll start off with my magic setups. This is my
Blood Magic altar. It's tier 3 in the picture. There's also the incense altar,
which I finally figured out what it's for and how to use it.

![Abyssalcraft](/assets/images/screenshots/minecraft/2020-02-12_11.44.40.png)

Here we have the very basic beginnings of Abyssalcraft. Abyssalcraft is the
Lovecraft mod essentially, and I'm not a huge fan, which is why I still haven't
gotten any further.

![Astral Sorcery](/assets/images/screenshots/minecraft/2020-02-12_11.44.58.png)

And here's my Astral Sorcery setup! Much larger and more advanced than last
time, and yet still not finished. It's a pretty mod, at least, even if having to
wait for night all the time is annoying.

![Lander on Jupiter](/assets/images/screenshots/minecraft/2020-02-18_18.05.05.png)

The endgame of this mod involves making spaceships and going to other planets,
which is mostly fun. Here is my lander on Jupiter, which is precariously
balanced on a pair of blocks in mid-air! It's a good thing I can fly.

![The Hole](/assets/images/screenshots/minecraft/2020-03-05_16.51.50.png)

And now... The Hole! Aka Mara is insane and has too much time on her hands. I
think this took me a week or two of digging to clear out fully, and that was
with some nice stuff. Unfortunately world destruction related items are banned
on the server, so I wasn't able to set up a quarry or anything like that.

![Other Side](/assets/images/screenshots/minecraft/2020-03-05_16.52.04.png)

It's a really big hole. I think I measured it to be somewhere around 250 x 190
when done, or something ridiculous like that.

![Even bigger!](/assets/images/screenshots/minecraft/2020-03-18_17.01.28.png)

And then I realized I hadn't finished. So it got bigger.

![Starting to fill it in](/assets/images/screenshots/minecraft/2020-03-18_17.01.54.png)

Once it was dug out I could start building! Stairs and my void miners are what
are in this picture.

And that's all the pics I have for this post! There are more coming, of course,
as things have gone even further and more advanced. It's actually starting to
resemble an actual base instead of a bunch of stuff stuck wherever there's room.

Thanks for reading, and may the Force be with you!
