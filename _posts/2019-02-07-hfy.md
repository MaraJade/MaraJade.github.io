HFY stands for "Humanity, Fuck Yeah!" I find it is best summed up by this tumblr
post:

 <div class="tumblr-post" data-href="https://embed.tumblr.com/embed/post/eMnUwfzCK2EdT9FzVV8noA/98105037171" data-did="fb96b5a070835bb550ae39b91bc802ca1140444f"><a href="http://dormantdemons.tumblr.com/post/98105037171/metamorphosiscosplay-silentstep">http://dormantdemons.tumblr.com/post/98105037171/metamorphosiscosplay-silentstep</a></div>  <script async src="https://assets.tumblr.com/post.js"></script>

This is where I'll be posting my stories in this genre. The first handful were
originally posted on the subreddit <a
href="https://reddit.com/r/HFY">/r/HFY</a>, (which is where I will continue
posting all future stories, I just wanted to put them here as well).
Unfortunately, I don't have the original posting dates for those, so the dates
on those will be the day I uploaded it, not the day it was originally written.
All future stories will have the correct days.

If you want to read more of this kind of thing, head on over to <a
href="https://reddit.com/r/HFY">/r/HFY</a>! There are lots of people there who
write many different types of stories using this theme, and they're all great.
