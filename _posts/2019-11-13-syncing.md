I finally managed to set up a system to sync my screenshots. Lovely program
called FreeFileSync. I've set up some tasks/cron jobs, so hopefully that will
simplify things a bit. The pictures should automatically move from my gaming
computer to my laptop, where I can then put them up on the website. Just as soon
as I figure out how to properly link images here...

There!

That's my current project. Took me a bit to dig out that hole, thank goodness
for the excavate modifier on my hammer!

Here it is a bit later. It has aurora blocks for walls, and moon dungeon brick
for the floor.

I don't have a more recent photo, things have advanced from those last ones. All
the extraneous stuff floating around has been removed, and I've made
considerable progress on rebuilding things.

Again, I don't have current photos, but that's an in-progress look at the giant
white building in the hole. I also just realized I don't have any shots looking
up to the rest of my base, but I'm not 100% sure what I'm going to do with that
part anyway. I have a list of tasks when I get on next, at least! Speaking of
which...
