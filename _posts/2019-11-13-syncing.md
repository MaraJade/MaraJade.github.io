I finally managed to set up a system to sync my screenshots. Lovely program
called FreeFileSync. I've set up some tasks/cron jobs, so hopefully that will
simplify things a bit. The pictures should automatically move from my gaming
computer to my laptop, where I can then put them up on the website. Just as soon
as I figure out how to properly link images here...

{% capture fig_img %}
![A giant hole in Minecraft]({{"marajade.github.io/assets/images/minecraft/2019-11-01_17.59.14.png" | relative_url }})
{% endcapture %}

<figure>
  {{ fig_img | markdownify | remove: "<p>" | remove: "</p>" }}
  <figcaption>A giant hole!</figcaption>
</figure>

There!

{% capture fig_img %}
![The same hole from the opposite side]({{ "/assets/images/minecraft/2019-11-01_17.59.39.png" | relative_url }})
{% endcapture %}

<figure>
  {{ fig_img | markdownify | remove: "<p>" | remove: "</p>" }}
  <figcaption>Yep, really big hole</figcaption>
</figure>

That's my current project. Took me a bit to dig out that hole, thank goodness
for the excavate modifier on my hammer!

{% capture fig_img %}
![Outlined hole]({{ "/assets/images/minecraft/2019-11-02_15.25.14.png" | relative_url }})
{% endcapture %}

<figure>
  {{ fig_img | markdownify | remove: "<p>" | remove: "</p>" }}
  <figcaption>Looks much nice now</figcaption>
</figure>

Here it is a bit later. It has aurora blocks for  walls, and moon dungeon brick
for the floor.

{% capture fig_img %}
![Updated hole from opposite side]({{ "/assets/images/minecraft/2019-11-02_15.25.34.png" | relative_url }})
{% endcapture %}

<figure>
  {{ fig_img | markdownify | remove: "<p>" | remove: "</p>" }}
  <figcaption>From the other angle</figcaption>
</figure>

I don't have a more recent photo, things have advanced from those last ones. All
the extraneous stuff floating around has been removed, and I've made
considerable progress on rebuilding things.

{% capture fig_img %}
![White dome with runes and lava]({{ "/assets/images/minecraft/2019-08-26_17.17.49.png" | relative_url }})
{% endcapture %}

  {{ fig_img | markdownify | remove: "<p>" | remove: "</p>" }}
  <figcaption>Lava garden</figcaption>
</figure>

Again, I don't have current photos, but that's an in-progress look at the giant
white building in the hole. I also just realized I don't have any shots looking
up to the rest of my base, but I'm not 100% sure what I'm going to do with that
part anyway. I have a list of tasks when I get on next, at least! Speaking of
which...
