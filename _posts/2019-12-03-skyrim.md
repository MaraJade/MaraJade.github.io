Welcome friends! Come and gather around the fire, for the weather outside is
frightful!

It turns out that Skyrim's screenshots are not where I thought they were, but I
have found them now, so I will share them with you! It will be an adventure for
all of us, because some of them are old and I don't remember the context, or
even which character it was. It'll be like your grandmother showing you that old
photo alblum, but with even more guessing!

Oh, if somehow you have gone almost 10 years without knowing things about this
game, spoilers!

Now let's see here, that appears to be the back of Whiterun from the northwest.
Not an angle I usually see it at.

This looks like an accidental screenshot, but if you zoom in on the water, you
will see there is a goat there.

Yup, just a goat. What are you even doing, goat?

I've been practicing my nature photography in Skyrim, so here is the first of
many shots. I'm not sure where this is, other than a cave somewhere.

Hmm, nope, no idea where this is. It's pretty though.

Ah, Sovengarde! (I spelled the wrong, didn't I...) It's so pretty, isn't it? I
wish you could spend more time there/visit again. I love the music, too.

Unfortunately the facemask makes it hard to tell who this is, but I think this
is the my most recent previous character, whose name is Areaen. She's a wood
elf, she's my "fuck it, just stealth archer" character.

Note to self: take off facemask when taking selfies.

So pretty.

This is Areaen! I wish the screenshot files were helpfully named, but they're
just numbers. Anyway, it gets cold in Skyrim, so this happens quite a bit in the
northern reaches.

I just realized I forgot to mention the fact that my Skyrim is pretty heavily
modded, so there's a lot of non-vanilla stuff. This is from some realism mods I
have installed, they make travelling in the snow a pain.

Brr.

I love the Eldergleam Sanctuary. It's so pretty. It's such a shame you have to
piss the tree off.

![Eldergleam](/assets/images/screenshots/skyrim/20190403195523_1.jpg)

So pretty!

Well that was quite a few screenshots, and I have a ton more, so I think I'll
stop here for now and do more later!

Thanks for reading, and may the Force be with you!
