Three days in, and I've already failed, haha. I want to post even just a little
thing every day, but I obviously didn't get anything up yesterday. Just a
combination of forgetfullness and lack of motivation. But I found a little bit
of that today, so there's that!

Yesterday was the 4th of July, aka Independence Day for America. We celebrate
our freedom from the British by blowing things up! Though I must admit, I am
getting slightly turned off of fireworks, in no small part because assholes like
to set them off at days/hours that aren't the night of the 4th. But it was an
okay day.
