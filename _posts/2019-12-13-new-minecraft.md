I've only shared a few screenshots from my current Minecraft base, and now I
won't be sharing any more. The server group I play on has decided that the old
instance of SevTech is old, buggy, and laggy, so they are finally updating it!
Unfortunately it is a major update, so it's also a server reset, which means I
have to start over. Mildly frustrating, as I did just get my base set up with
Refined Storage, but oh well. This will be take 5 or so. Every time I go through
SevTech I get better and more efficent, so that's a bonus!

I will do my best to take more screenshots this time! I already have things
mostly setup, so hopefully I will be more on top of things this time around.

I did also take this opportunity to switch to the MultiMC launcher, as Twitch
and FTB are parting ways soon. The main downside of this is having to redo all
my settings, but it's not too bad. My main complaint right now is that I have to
wait until Sunday to start, as I'm not a Patron. I can wait two days, though,
especially as I wasn't playing recently anyway.

Fortunately they opened another modpack I'm interested in up to the public right
before this: SkyFactory 4. SkyFactory is a form of SkyBlock, which is a modpack
where you start with a block of dirt and a dirt tree. A dirt tree? Yes, a tree
that drops resources that let you make dirt. It's from a mod called Sky
Orchards, which lets you grow trees with most basic and quite a few not basic
resources. It's neat. So that's the Minecraft I'm playing until SevTech is open
for me.

Thanks for reading, and may the Force be with you!
