In the beginning, there was a website. The webmaster looked upon it, and saw
that it was good. Well, mostly. It's still a bit of a work in progress, but it's
almost there. Anyway, the webmaster wanted to use the website, though they were
not entirely sure for what. So they started writing a post, and here we are!

Welcome to the first day of the rest of my life!

Dramatic? Maybe, but you might feel the same if you'd finally graduated from
college after taking twice as long as expected. But I finally got the email
confirming my graduation a couple days ago, and I am super happy!

I suppose I should introduce myself, this being the first actual post on my
website and all. I'm Mara, and I'm in charge of this place! I am, as I
mentioned, a recent graduate, having just obtained my Computer Science degree.
I'm currently unemployed, but looking for a nice programming job. And, of
course, I am a nerd. Computers, Star Wars, and The Lord of the Rings are just
the three big things I am a fan of, there are many more things I would be happy
to ramble at you for hours about!

This is the third (fourth?) attempt at a website, I'm hoping this one sticks.
Between hosting this on github and finding an awesomely customizeable theme, I
think I've finally got this thing in a working order.

My main plan at the moment is to just write blog posts, even if they're short
and without purpose, and seeing where that takes me. I'd like to get back into
my writing, and I have some mildly ambitious plans to start a podcast. But all
of that requires regular effort, so we're gonna start small. It's a lesson i've
been trying to learn recently, maybe I'll write a post about it later.

That's a short overview of things, I hope it's not too incoherent!
Until next time, May the Force be with you!
