The devs updated SevTech, and in doing so they fixed several issues with plugins
commonly used on servers. So the MYM team decided to restart the SevTech
server... again! I've lost track of the number of times I've restarted this
pack, I think it's like take 5 or 6 at this point.

The server is much better this time, things are (mostly) generated correctly,
except the shoggoth lairs going a bit crazy, so there are a lot of them in
swamps now. And mob spawning is still way too low, but that's not a new issue.

My time on this version started very well: my first random teleport took me to a village on
a river below a darklands, with a coralium infested swamp on the other side! It
was like teleporting into heaven.

I decided to rush it this time, doing the bare minimum to to advance to the next
age; mostly because I wanted to get JourneyMap ASAP. It worked well until I hit
Industrial Engineering in age 3, which slowed me down a bit. Steel is so
sloooowww. But now I'm in age 4, so I've finally paused to build up my base a
bit properly; going to the moon requires a lot of effort. I have my IE stuff
more or less set up at this point, and have started digging out the hill again.

I actually have something resembling a plan this time: I want to make my base,
at least the surface part, look how I imagine the imperial palace in Carthak
looked: a half circle with wings sticking out as rays. I found some nice circle
guides, which helps a lot. Circles in minecraft are hard.

And, as usual, I have learned a lot from my last go-through, so I have an even
better idea of what to do and how to do it. Now if only Astral Sorcery didn't
require night for most of it's stuff...

Thanks for reading, and may the Force be with you!
