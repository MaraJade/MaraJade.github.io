Hey there! I'm Mara, and I'm in charge of this mess. This is attempt number
something for my website, but I think I've finally found a setup that works for
me, and hopefully that will encourage me to use it as regularly as I want to!

If you didn't figure it out from the name of the site, or my username, I am a
massive nerd in general, and obsessed with Star Wars specifically. I'm also just
finishing my computer science degree, so add computers to my list of interests.
Yes, that includes video games as well!

I do a bit of writing, and have some plans for a podcast. I have so many plans,
I just hope I can actually do them!
